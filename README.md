ABUSKOSI shall become a universal programming environment for strategic (wargames and) conflict simulations.
The name itself actually is an acronym of this. It's just been translated to another language: "AusgangsBasis f√ºr Universelle Strategische (kriegsspiele und) KOnfliktSImulationen".

### Just a remark

Right now a lot of docs are written down in german only (especially project planning stuff), but don't feel scared about this.
It's just that currently all contributors are natively speaking german, so we simply decided to ease our lives. :)

Nevertheless, on the long run we want to address international audiance and contributors.
Our source code comments are already english. (Feel free to blame me if you find any other and I will correct this!)
The reminder of the project shall follow to "international-mode" when either:
* we feel our project has a certain degree of maturity or
* interesting contributions start to drop in from the international area or
* there is any reasonable interest outside of DE/AT/CH on this project

## Project goals

On the long run the targets of this project are:
* to provide a universal framework for strategic wargames and conflict simulations
  (i.a. shall it serve as a unified foundation for various games the project initiator had in mind like "NeroRost"-universes.)
* establish and maintain a cross platform compability, meaning both developers (Linux, Windows, macOS) and gamers (Linux, Windows, macOS, later including: Retropie, Android, maybe Playstation, etc.) alike
* level up the knowhow and technical experise of all (core-)developers 

Further project goals that depend on the outcome of several evaluation phases:
* Either commit to an already existing (open source) game engine
* Or continue its development as a fork
* Or develop an entirely new game engine
